# Simple Flask+Angular site for a slick projects website

Currently based heavily on https://github.com/shea256/angular-flask.

# Status:
Modifications for project focus and different look started, 
can finish a basic version soon.

# Notes to Alex:
Take a look at the /static/js/app and /static/js/partials. 
Right now I just modified the posts to be projects, added some
more categories at the top, and rewrote the list to be a grid.
Still need to make the grid entry as well as project details
page, but should be easy. 


# TODO: 
Implement model/backend
Create initial grid display+project details page
Create about+contact page (more?)
Deploy on Rasberry Pi (?)
Make it work on Docker (? pretty easy as is...)
